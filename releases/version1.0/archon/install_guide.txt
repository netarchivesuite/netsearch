Archon install guide:

Copy archon.properties to the home-directory and change to location of the H2 database.
Copy the empty H2 database file to the desired location.
Install netarchive-archon.war in a web-server (Tomcat or Jetty)
The index build-server is an obvious choice for location of the server

See archon_screenshot.png to see how it looks like when Archon is installed correct.

Add an arc-file:
Use POST url: localhost:xxxx/netarchive-archon/services/addARC/{full path to file}

If you move your arc-files location(but not filename) can update this information also
Use POST url: localhost:xxxx/netarchive-archon/services/addOrUpdateARC/{full path to file}
You can also use this to add new files. If they exist the folder will be updated.

Scripts to add multiple files:

register_arc_files_in_folder.sh:
This adds or updates location for all arc-files from a given folder 

register_add_ALL_arc_files.sh:
This adds all arc-files recursive from folders (change line 3 to specify folders)


To backup the database POST url: localhost:xxxx/netarchive-archon/services/system/backup_database
I suggest making a backup after every index has been build.
