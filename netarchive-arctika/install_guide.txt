Arctika install guide:

Copy the entire folder (the index build-server is an obvious choice).
Arctika.properties:
Change the port/server names to match your setup.
The property 'arctika.max_concurrent_workers' should match the number of CPUs in the server.
The property 'arctika.shardId' must be manually increased when an index has been completed. Also remember
to delete the index before starting a index build with a new shardid.


From github you need to clone and build: https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery
In the warc-indexer maven sub-module you take the warc-indexer-2.0.2-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar from
the target folder and also copy that into the arctika folder. (or later version)

In 'start_indexer.sh' just change the folder locations to match your setup.
When you start the indexer both the  Archon and Solr-server must be up an running.
If you stop this process you can just restart it and will continue from where it left.
When the index has reached the given index-size, the process will terminate and log (indexer.log)
that the index build has completed.
